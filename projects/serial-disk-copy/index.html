<p>I wrote a programm that transfers old Macintosh Volumes over Serialport to a modern Computer.
I needed it to make a 1:1 copy of my old data, so I could recover already deleted files.</p>
<p>[Image url=&quot;./blabli.jpg&quot; description=&quot;Screenshot of \&quot;mySerialCopier\&quot;&quot;]</p>
<p>I found an old Harddisk with some data on it I wanted to recover.
Because the old Macs use SCSI as their peripheral interface, this one is a very exotic SCSI 40pin Harddisk, I couldnt just attach it to my current computer. Instead of ordering a adapter, I decided to buy the original computer, which the harddisk came width.</p>
<p>I found A PowerBook 145b on ebay-kleinanzeigen.de for 25 bucks plus 25 bucks shipping.</p>
<p>To recover all bits from the harddisk I wrote a Programm with the Macintosh Programmers Workshop, which is the original Apple IDE for developing on the Mac. I ran it in the Basilisk II Emulator, because its much faster than devloping on the real Machine. The programm basicly does following:</p>
<ul>
<li>let the user choose the volume and blocksize (8192 bytes seems to be a good option there)</li>
<li>open the serial driver and configure it (8 bit 1 stop bit no parity, 55400 baud -&gt; max speed on the old macs ;-), no hardware checks )</li>
<li>open the disk driver that is used for the provided volume (interesting note: the old macs save the diskdriver on the scsi disk itself!!!)</li>
<li>send start bytes and disk size over the serial port</li>
<li>for every block: read block, calculate crc checksum, send it over serial</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other end I wrote a python script that grabbs the data from the serial port and saves them to a file. When done it prints a short summary of the CRC errors that occured. (I never had an CRC error, but its important to know if you ever have one)</p>
<p>Now I simply connected the tx-&gt;rx and ground pins from the Mac to my current machines serial port:

To see the actual data, I also connected my oszilloscope ;-)...</p>
<p>So this is very simple one way communication and the code is also not tidied up, but it worked quite well on my powerbook.
So feel free to use it too, if you need it:</p>
